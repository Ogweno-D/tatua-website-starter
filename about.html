        <div class="story">
           <p>
               Founded in 2020 by former enterprise support leaders, Tatua was born from frustration with outdated ticketing systems.
               We've processed over 2 million support tickets and helped companies reduce response times by an average of 45%.
           </p>
            <p>
                After experiencing the pain of managing support operations at scale, our founders knew there had to a better way.
                Traditional ticketing systems were slow, inflexible, and created more problems than they solved.
